# Performance & Data Analyst

## Who I Am & What Drives Me
Hi! I'm Laura — a curious, driven, and data-loving professional. I’m passionate about transforming data into meaningful insights that solve problems, boost efficiency, and support smarter decision-making. I have hands-on experience in Business Intelligence and Industrial Performance, where I build dynamic Power BI dashboards, manage key performance indicators (KPIs), and lead quality-focused initiatives related to cost and process optimization.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Technological Chemistry from the University of São Paulo - IQSC/USP (2023), and a technical degree in Industrial Chemistry from ETEC Francisco Garcia (2017). I’m currently enrolled in the General Business Program at BTC, where I’m enhancing my knowledge in corporate strategy, finance, negotiations, marketing, and investment.

I'm always looking for smarter ways to do things,using the right tools and methodologies to drive real improvements.

What really excites me is using data not just to understand what’s happening — but to make things better. I’m proactive, analytical, and constantly pushing myself to grow. I thrive on challenges, love to collaborate, and believe that data has the power to transform businesses when used with purpose and creativity. 

## Professional Journey
I currently work as a Performance Analyst at a French multinational company operating in over 100 countries. In this role, I help connect strategy to execution through data — with a strong focus on implementing and managing key performance indicators (KPIs) across teams in Brazil, the United States and Europe.

In a previous initiative, I had the opportunity to led a corporate-level PDCA cycle that contributed to a measurable increase in the output of one of the company’s most profitable products. I also design and maintain Power BI dashboards that translate data into clear, actionable insights for leaders across regions — always focusing on consistency and clarity. A key part of my work is ensuring that quality-related KPIs are reliable, standardized globally and contiuously improved.

Take a look at my projects to see what I’ve been working on — each one reflects a part of my journey and everything I’ve been learning along the way.
