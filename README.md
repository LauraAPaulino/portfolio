# Performance & Data Analyst

## Who I Am & What Drives Me
Hi! I'm Laura — a curious, driven, and data-loving professional. I’m passionate about transforming data into meaningful insights that solve problems, boost efficiency, and guide smart decisions. I have hands-on experience in Business Intelligence and Industrial Performance, where I build dynamic Power BI dashboards, manage key performance indicators (KPIs), and lead quality-driven projects focused on cost and process optimization. My academic journey reflects a solid foundation in science, enriched by a growing passion for data-driven decision-making, business understanding, and continuous improvement.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Technological Chemistry from the University of São Paulo - IQSC/USP (2023), and a technical degree in Industrial Chemistry from ETEC Francisco Garcia (2017). I’m currently enrolled in the General Business Program at BTC, where I’m enhancing my knowledge in corporate strategy, finance, negotiations, marketing, and investment.

I'm always looking for smarter ways to do things, using methodologies to make real improvements.

What really excites me is using data not just to understand what’s happening — but to make things better. I’m proactive, analytical, and constantly pushing myself to grow. I thrive on challenges, love to collaborate, and believe that data has the power to transform businesses when used with purpose and creativity. 

Check out my projects and what I’ve been working on — each one shows a bit of my journey and everything I’ve been learning along the way.

## Key Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
